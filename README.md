_Note: previously named Neuro Task Starter, some references may still refer to it as such._

## Introduction

Honeycomb is an open source task-template repository that combines well-accepted practices and technologies from the cognitive science and web development communities to build psychophysiological tasks that support lab equipment recordings and are ready for deployment to different settings (desktop or online) without significant changes to the code base.

It is maintained by members of the [Center for Computation and Visualization](https://ccv.brown.edu) and the [Neuromotion Lab](http://borton.engin.brown.edu/) at Brown University.
